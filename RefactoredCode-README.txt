Exception Handling: All code should be encapsulated within try-catch blocks to ensure that any exceptions are gracefully managed without interrupting the application flow.
Consistent Responses: Responses provided by the controller should follow a standardized structure, ensuring uniformity across the API and facilitating predictable responses for the frontend.
Use of Translations: All response messages, error messages, and text should leverage language translation files, adhering to localization best practices and improving application accessibility.
Data Validation with FormRequest: Validation should be performed using Laravelâ€™s FormRequest classes before entering the controller, ensuring that only sanitized and validated data reaches the controller logic.
Dependence on Repository Responses: Responses returned to the frontend should accurately reflect the output from repository functions. This approach maintains consistency between backend processes and frontend expectations, minimizing discrepancies.
Clear Commenting for Code Blocks: Each block of code should be clearly commented to explain its purpose, enhancing readability and maintainability, and providing context for other developers.

There is always space for code refactoring and implementing best practices
